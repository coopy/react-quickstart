React Quickstart
================

_React + Webpack === yum!_

This is a quickstart project aimed at getting you writing React.js apps with a minimum of configuration. Instead of relying on build tools like grunt or gulp, it uses only webpack and npm `scripts`.

### Workflow

1. Start webpack-dev-server

        npm run dev

2. Run application

        open http://localhost:8080

By default, the dev server uses source maps, so you can debug source files in your favorite browser dev tool. If you need this, use the `npm run dev-fast` script, which is faster and only maps errors to the appropriate source file and line.
